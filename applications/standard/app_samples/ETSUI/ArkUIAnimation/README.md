# Animation

## Introduction

This sample demonstrates the effect of the **AnimatorProperty** and **Explicit Animation**.

## Usage

1. Touch the round image on the home screen of the sample app to expand other images. This demonstrates the implementation of rotation and translation. Touch the round image again to collapse the images.

2. Touch any expanded image to play the **AnimatorProperty**. This demonstrates the implementation of the rotation, scaling, and opacity change of the image.

3. Touch the plus sign at the bottom of the home screen to increase the number of images. Touch the minus sign to decrease the number of images. The maximum number of images is 8, and the minimum number is 3. The default number is **3**.

## Constraints

This sample can only be run on standard-system devices.

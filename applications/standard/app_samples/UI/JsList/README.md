# JSList Offerings

### Introduction

This sample shows the application of the **<list\>** component in the offering classification list. In **<listGroup\>**, two **<list-item\>** components are used to display the list in the collapsed and expanded state, respectively. After a list is touched, the corresponding list items are displayed.

### Usage Instructions

1. This sample app uses the collapsed list page as the initial page. The initial page uses **<list-item\>** as the child component of **<list\>** to display three categories: **Phones**, **Tablets**, and **Smart Office**. Touching any of the categories will display the corresponding offerings. If you touch an expanded list, the list is collapsed.

2. You can add, delete, and modify offering data in each category in the **en-US.json** file and view the changes on the corresponding page.

### Constraints

This sample can only be run on standard-system devices.

# Page Routing

### Introduction

This sample shows how to use the **router** API to implement page redirection and pass parameters during page redirection.

### Usage

Click the text link on the page. The specified page is displayed.

### Constraints

The **router** API can be invoked only after page rendering is complete. Do not call the API in **onInit** and **onReady** when the page is still in the rendering phase.

This sample can only be run on standard-system devices.

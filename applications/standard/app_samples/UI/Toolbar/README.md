# Toolbar

### Introduction

The **<toolbar\>** component is placed at the bottom of a page to display available operations on the page. Its child component **<toolbar-item\>** represents an operation option on the toolbar. You must set an image and text for the child component. This sample provides a toolbar that simulates the operations for reading an e-book.

### Usage

The sample app provides a contents list on the home screen. You can touch an item in the list to access the corresponding chapter, touch the chapter content to display the toolbar, and touch the operation options on the toolbar to change the page attributes or jump to another chapter.

### Constraints

This sample can only be run on standard-system devices.

# Creation and Access of Native-based Data Abilities



### Introduction

This sample shows how to create and access a Data ability in Extended TypeScript (eTS). Data abilities are added, deleted, updated, and queried using interfaces implemented through the rational database (RDB), and accessed using **DataAbilityHelper**.

### Usage

1. On the home page of the sample app, touch **Batch insert** in the upper right corner or **+** in the lower right corner to insert a data record to the Data ability through the **DataAbilityHelper**.

2. Touch **X** next to the new data record in the list to delete the record.

3. Touch a data record in the list to edit the record on the editing page. After the editing is complete, touch **âœ“** to save the data and return to the home page.

4. On the home page, touch the search box at the top of the list to enter the search page. Enter the keyword for search. The data that contains the keyword is displayed in the list.



### Constraints

This sample can only be run on standard-system devices.

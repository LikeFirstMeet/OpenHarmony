# Querying the DDM Result Set

### Introduction

This sample shows how to create a query object to query data in a key-value (KV) store and obtain the result set in distributed data management (DDM).

### Usage

1. Touch **Add Data** to save the template data to the RDB store.

2. Touch **Query the Result Set** to obtain the result set that contains the specified key.

3. Touch **Query the Specified Value Entry** to obtain the result set that contains the specified key based on the predicate.

4. Touch **And Condition Query** and specify the predicate to obtain the result set in which **FieldNode** is not a specific value.

5. Touch **Query Results in Descending Order** to obtain the result set in which **FieldNode** is not a specific value and list the values in descending order.

6. Touch **Query Smaller Than Value** to obtain the KV pairs whose **FieldNode** is less than the specified value based on the predicate.

### Constraints

This sample can only be run on standard-system devices.
